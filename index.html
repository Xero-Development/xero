      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The X Project is a small virtual machine built in Node.js, designed specifically for hosting
        and creating Discord bots. Instead of acting like a full general-purpose VM, it keeps things
        focused: clean execution, bot-safe behavior, and tools geared toward Discord development.
        The whole point is to make a controlled environment where bot creators can build, test,
        and run their code without fuss.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs Discord bot code in a limited, safe environment</li>
        <li>Built‑in helpers for command handling and event routing</li>
        <li>Restricted execution so bots can't step outside allowed actions</li>
        <li>Simple plugin model for adding bot‑related tools</li>
        <li>Lightweight Node.js foundation for quick deployment</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
      <span class="tag">Node.js</span>
      <span class="tag">JavaScript</span>
      <span class="tag">Bytecode</span>
      <span class="tag">VM Design</span>
      <p>
        Everything is built with regular JavaScript running on Node.js. No heavy frameworks,
        no layers of abstraction. The goal is to make the VM easy to read and modify so you
        can learn from it or use it as a base for your own ideas.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The VM is meant to be a dedicated space for Discord bot creation. No unrelated features,
        no bloated systems. Just a controlled setup where developers can write commands, test events,
        and run their bots with predictable behavior. It reduces the risk of unsafe code and keeps
        everything focused on Discord development.
      </p>

      <section>
      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>v0.1: Basic VM with isolated execution for Discord bot scripts</li>
        <li>v0.2: Built‑in Discord event simulation (message events, interactions, etc.)</li>
        <li>v0.3: Command handler module and permission sandboxing</li>
        <li>v0.4: Plugin system for bot tools like logging, metrics, and mock guilds</li>
        <li>v1.0: Stable release focused exclusively on bot development and hosting</li>
      </ul>
